- # What is this site?
  This is my personal site where i will post some stuff (sometimes when I'm not lazy) c:  
  I wrote it using [dioxus](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus) just so people can read more info about me, I also plan to share some of my samples when i'm done packing them. In the future if i make enough money from my sucKessful music career i will move this site to a server or shared hosting and switch client side rendering to server side rendering, but for now I'm just gonna leave it in github pages.  
- # What am I going to blog?
  I'm planning to blog my thoughts and experiences regarding certain topics, usually, of course, it's going to  be music related. But i also plan to do more technical stuff like sharing my experience with certain  App, Framework, Library, etc. maybe I'll throw some cool tricks i learned in a DAW or something like that and notes about my releases or maybe I'll document some cool VST plugin that i found. Hopefully I'm not gonna just throw it under the rug and never write a blog post after a couple of days.  
- # Why?
  So the other day my friend asked me to teach him music, and of course, i agreed, but while teaching, i realized that it's very hard for me to put into words something that i understand  but need to explain. After that I thought about the ways of improving in forming my sentences  and thought that writing would help me with that. PLUS i wanted to document some of the stuff i do online, maybe someone will find it useful.
