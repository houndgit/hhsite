Heya, my name is HeavenHound, Heav for short.

I'm a music producer, and i release music under different pseudonyms/alisas.

I love making music just for the sake of it and think of it as a form of self expression more than a financial gain and that's why all my music on my bandcamp available for free ᵃᵗ ˡᵉᵃˢᵗ ᶠᵒʳ ⁿᵒʷ

I started making electronic music back in 2019. Funnily enough I started by producing synthwave at that time, later on i became more experienced and could make whatever i wanted without thinking about genre, length or style. I usually just make whatever comes to mind at that time and assign it to a specific alias of mine, check out my alias page for more info about my music and aliases.
